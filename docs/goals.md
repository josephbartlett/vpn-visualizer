# Project Goals

- Make VPN concepts approachable with visuals and plain language.
- Enable guided, low-jargon setup for non-technical teammates.
- Provide live feedback (metrics + troubleshooting) without exposing sensitive data.
- Keep the stack portable via Docker-only workflows.
- Prepare for backend integration with minimal UI changes.
- Support AWS-first scenarios (Client VPN, Site-to-Site, sidecars) with callouts for VPC/subnet/SG/routing.
